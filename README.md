Hello world!

This is my first project with Refonte Learning.

I have build the landing page of web app for Trafalgar, a healthcare provider.

The project figma design is https://www.figma.com/design/EWmzcVkd7qbP5Nf7iMvuqP/Trafalgar-Landing-Page?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=KJMamd17qydajnSH-0

The app is developed to be responsive across different devices: mobile phones, tablets and laptops.

I built this using React. The app consists of HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript code.
