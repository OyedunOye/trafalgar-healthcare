# Hello world!

## ðŸ‘‹Hi, I'm Shade ðŸ™‚

This is my first internship project with Refonte Learning.

I have built the landing page of web app for Trafalgar, a healthcare provider.

You can checkout the figma design which I used for this frontend development at https://www.figma.com/design/EWmzcVkd7qbP5Nf7iMvuqP/Trafalgar-Landing-Page?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=KJMamd17qydajnSH-0

The webpage is developed to be responsive across different devices, including:
* mobile phones
* tablets
* laptops

Technologies employed in the development are:
* React framwwork
* TypeScript
* CSS

#Thank you!
